# TikTok-AI-Auto
In early stage. Sandbox version <br>

TikTok-AI-Auto is a proof of concept project that automates the process of calling the TikTok API to publish AI-generated images. <br> 
The program first makes a call to the TikTok API for login and token gathering. It then calls the API's serverless AI-generator to generate an image, which is stored on a web-hosted server. <br> 
Finally, another call to the TikTok API is made to directly post the generated image on the logged profile.
